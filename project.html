The physiotherapist, the physical Educator and/or the Sport Coach can change all variables of each game according to special needs of therapy or performance goals of your patient, athlete or team. They also can make assessments and monitoring the evolution with a level of details that could not be achieved with the naked eyes.

              A <strong>joyful</strong> and <strong>motivating</strong> game environment for players. In this first phase, two main games will be developed. The first one is about cognitive tasks including memorization and reasoning. The second one is about physical tasks, where the player needs to perform some specific movements that require reaction time, precision and accurate. The chosen game will assume the setup made by your therapist and/or coach where specific stimuli will be generated

              According U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1 in 4 adults in US have some type of disability, more than 8.5 million have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs, and 6.7 million have serious difficulty concentrating, remembering or making decisions. In Brazil this is not different, where 24% of the whole population have some disability. Mobility, cognition and independent living represents most of the problems found in both countries as well as we can observe great similarity between the populations, like difficult access and high cost of healthcare services, lower levels of quality of life, great demand for assistance and health indicators comparing to people without disabilities.

          Thus, the possibility to have access to a specialized program of activities that can be practiced at home with the use of low-cost devices such as cell phones and notebooks with internet connection can improve the permanence into these activities and, consequently, positively change the health indicators. The implementation PLUSREHAB.ORG can bring a great set of tools and assume important role in the union between real and virtual rehabilitation, as virtual reality games become more accessible and widespread, data on the metabolic cost of specific movement games will help consumers, coaches and rehabilitation professionals in the development of new disease-specific exercise programs. As challenge, both professional and institution need to incorporate digital tools in their routines.

              It is a partnership between ADIPPNE and PATER-USP that share the goal to actively improve the quality of life of people with disabilities. Since 2008, ADIPPNE encourage and promote the inclusion of people with disabilities, by encouraging sports practises, educational support and training courses whitin community. We participated in the international studies program representing the Brazilian Paralympic project, and received the title of pioneer of Paralympic sports practises with table tennis by the USA.<br><br>ADIPPNE has a partnership with University of São Paulo (USP) delivering inclusive activities. We are volunteers in the Research and Technological Application in Rehabilitation Group (PATER) using new technologies to improve quality of life for its groups.<br><br>With 11 years of expertise in serious games research, the PATER made possible to scientifically validate its effectiveness from initial prototyping to use by thousands of people. As a case study, www.movehero.com.br was made available at COVID-19 pandemic for people with disabilities that who had to be quarantined at home but who needed to keep their treatment. From April-20 to January-22, 1,496 people played 25.634 matches supervised by their therapists, which represents movement stimulus for 1,716,023 targets to be reached. The PATER will technically support the project.
